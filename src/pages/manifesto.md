title: Business is an Art üñºÔ∏è

Identity is fraught. An ambiguous concept; this is as true in the lives of an individual as it is for a corporate entity. <br>
Through law, business has been enshrined with unique capabilities, buttressed by the veil which allows entities to surround profits and eliminate liability. <br>
Comes with ***responsibility*** <br>
Whatever your ideological precepts, the era of being seen is upon us. Regulators want to know who the business is and what it does. <br>
The *LEI* helps accomplish this in a straightforward manner: *the 20-digit, alphanumeric code feeds machines*. <br>
It is built for big data. It is built to be consumed. <br>
We believe in privacy for the individual in matters of conscience. <br>
In business, we believe corporations have an intersubjective right to be known. There is no such thing as an individual business. <br>
Every entity exists as part of a network, drawing profits here, creating idiosyncratic supply chains there, paying contributors. In essence, ***business is never an isolated activity***. <br>
And with this high-and-mighty theory in sight, we also express commitment to a simpler cause: that of *service*. <br>
Query anyone whether they would prefer to type their full name or enter credit card information one-digit at a time into a box. <br> Outside the nobles who religiously guard against any impingement on sovereignty, the deciding factor is speed and ease. <br>
And while we respect these noble outsiders in the chase to create an identity function which is both privacy-preserving and allows for the natural function of jurisdictional oversight to proceed, our game is to simplify the task at-hand. <br>
Create better processes. <br>
Using the LEI as a pertinent case, we have winnowed down maintenance and registration as much as possible for an identity housed by a centrally authoritative source. <br>
We strive to create a perfect meeting point between ruthless machine optimization and conciliatory human expertise. Maybe this is something like poetry. <br><br>

Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art.
