> <h3>The Company</h3>

CB Essential Services, LLC is a New York limited liability company whose registered office is at 68-07 Fresh Pond Road, Flushing, NY 11385.

The Company operates as an Official Registration Agent of the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).

The Company operates as an Official Registration Agent for the GLEIF in the name of the Client and cooperates with a GLEIF accredited Local Operating Unit (LOU) to order or renew Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) for its clients.

The Company is not legally affiliated with any LOU and may use different LOUs depending on the prevailing conditions within the market. The Company does not operate as a LOU in respect of LEIs.

 <h2><p style="text-align: center;">Contractual Process</p></h2>

By the Client submitting an Order for a LEI, the Client agrees to these Terms together with [the Company's Privacy Policy](https://cbessential.services/privacy-policy/).

The Client gives all rights to the Company to apply for a new LEI code or extend an existing LEI on the Client's behalf as well as sign [the Terms of the selected LOU, RapidLEI](https://rapidlei.com/documents/global-lei-system-terms/).

The Applicant confirms it has full authority to apply for a LEI or authorize extension on behalf of the Legal Entity. Additionally, the Applicant is made aware it may need to supply a Letter of Authorization (LoA) confirming this.

An Order will be counted as Final after the Client has submitted payment and the payment is received by the Company.

- If the Company is unable to complete a Client's Order, it shall notify the Client as soon as reasonably practicable.

- Client is made aware that if notified and requested information is not presented, the Company cannot proceed with the Order and no binding obligation to supply services shall arise.

<h2><p style="text-align: center;">Time-frame</p></h2>

The Company will start the LEI application after the Client has submitted an Order.

The LEI code will be issued as soon as Client's Signing Authority and LE-RD data is confirmed.

- In some cases, a LEI will be issued in under 2 hours.

- In most cases, a LEI will be issued in under 24 hours.

The LEI code will be extended as soon as the current Managing Local Operating Unit (LOU) agrees to the transfer or 3 business days elapse. This is a back-office process which does not affect the validity of Client's previously assigned LEI.

If the Client has submitted insufficient or erroneous data, the process can only be resumed once the Company has acquired necessary information from the Client.

<h2><p style="text-align: center;">Order Types </p></h2>

The Client has different Order Types available to it. The process for each is described below.

<h4>Register New LEI</h4>

- For Clients which have never been issued a LEI

The Client either:

1. Has a registered director serve as Applicant; or

2. Has LoA signed by registered director granting signatory power to the Applicant.

<h4>Extend Existing LEI</h4>

- For Clients which have been issued a LEI

The Client must:

1. Have a registered director sign and return a LoA to the Company. Entails authorization to transfer Client's LOU.

<h2><p style="text-align: center;">Payment Plan</p></h2>

<h5>Billing</h5>

The Client will be billed on a recurring and periodic schedule ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set on a yearly basis and begin as soon as an initial payment is processed. Either order type can be billed for a service length as set out below.

<h5>Service Length</h5>

The Company manages LEI renewals for the Client on a yearly basis.

In doing so, Client grants the Company:

1. Indefinite right to renew LEIs;

2. Automatically process payment along the established Billing Cycle.

<h5>Cancellation/Failure</h5>

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Plan will automatically renew under the same conditions unless:

1. Cancelled by the Client;

2. Cancelled by the Company.

Cancel a Payment Plan by contacting [the Company's customer support](mailto:support@cbessential.services). This change will be reflected in the next Billing Cycle.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the Billing Cycle as indicated on the invoice.

<h5>Methods</h5>

The Client will pay pricing associable to the selected payment plan via regular bank wire to the bank account nominated by the Company. The Client shall pay all fees in full without deduction or set-off and in cleared funds.

Payments are only accepted in USD (United States Dollar)

A valid payment method, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover, is required to process the payment. You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and any other valid payment information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize the Company to charge selected fees along a schedule as previosuly outlined in this section.

<h2><p style="text-align: center;">Pricing </p></h2>

A full list of available pricing can be found [on the Website](cbessential.services).

Prices do not include sales tax. Sales tax will be added as the Company deems required.

The Company may offer discounts for bulk purchasing multiple LEIs. Such discounts would be at the Company's discretion and agreed between the Client and Company prior to ordering.

The Company may increase pricing at any time by giving the Client not less than 30 days prior written notice from Billing Cycle termination or renewal date.
